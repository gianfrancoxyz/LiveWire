This is a quick project to DIY a charging dock for Logitech PowerPlay compatible mice.

Yes, there are docks available on Amazon. Yes, they're not that expensive.
But this is way cooler. 

Currently, the parts required to complete this project are:
1x CNC machine and single-sided PCB, or a PCB source.
1x 3D printer for the base. (? g)
3x Screws.
2x 1x1 Pin Headers
2x Jumper wires 
1x USB (of your choice) breakout board.

To-Do:
{X}	2/14/21	Start
{}	Finish the mk1 PCB by sizing screw holes, lines, and moving the (+) indicator.
{}	Test out the function and snap-into-place-yness.
{}	Create basic 3D model for stand.
{}	Figure out how to weight it down to avoid adhesive.
{}	Modify PCB to use square head screws instead of square test pads.
{}	Modify 3D files for new PCB
{}	Cleanup, finalize.
